# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

Titanic Project Example Walk Through
In this notebook, the goal is to correctly predict if someone survived the Titanic shipwreck.
Overview
1) Understand the shape of the data (Histograms, box plots, etc.)
2) Data Cleaning
3) Data Exploration
4) Feature Engineering
5) Data Preprocessing for Model
6) Basic Model Building
7) Model Tuning
8) Ensemble Modle Building
9) Results

Used Kaggle Dataset and build a classification model to predict the possibility of survival for titanic dataset
